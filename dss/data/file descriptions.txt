Description of the files used by the simple application get_dss.exe using getdss.dll for decompressing
the real sky (or DDS) images.

A "#" character at the beginning of the line indicates that this line is a comment line and is being ignored.

The files are read by the software in 80 character records. the file themselves do not contain new line chracters and are organized as one single record/string of characters.
