Preservation of some DSS decompression software

We attemp to preserve some software that was used for the RealSky CDs to decompress the images.
There is also some software to do the same written for VAX/VMS

The original softwore and CDs are no longer available and the once provided version does not runf on a modern 64 bit machine.
This is an attempt to possibly be able to decompress tthe files. It is based on the sources provided by the original author
as it can be found on the projectpluto.org website.
