Preservation of some DSS decompression software

We attempt to preserve some software that was used for the RealSky CDs to decompress the images.
There is also some software to do the same written for VAX/VMS. The original GETIMAGE verion 1.3.

The original software and CDs are no longer available and the once provided version does not run on a modern 64 bit machine.
This is an attempt to possibly be able to decompress the files. It is based on the sources provided by the original author
as it can be found on the www.projectpluto.org website.

The origins of the software go back to the StSci which also allows access to images in FITS format generated from the original
scans of POSS. 
it can be found under https://gsss.stsci.edu/Software/Software.htm .

Be aware that the original compressed files published by the "Astronomical Society of the Pacific" on CD (North and South) under the name RealSky are under copywright.
